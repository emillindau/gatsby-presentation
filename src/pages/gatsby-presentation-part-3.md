# Gatsby vs Next.js

Holmberg Ã¤ger
Both next.js and Gatsby are more than CRA, they are tools (which means that they enforce certain things). Both provide boilerplate code and are performant SPA's.

But there is a difference, and quite a big one depending on your needs.
Next.js is server side rendered and Gatsby is statically generated, meaning that gatsby generates statics files, it doesn't need a server. Next.js dynamically renders HTML every time a new request comes to the server.
Essentially that is Build time vs. run time.

Gatsby also dictates how you should handle your data by enforcing GraphQL. Sort of. Next.js has some neat components for routing. You get the gist.
