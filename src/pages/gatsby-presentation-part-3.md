# Gatsby vs Next.js

Both next.js and Gatsby are more than CRA. Bot provide boilerplate, performant, spa. But here's the difference
Next.js is server side rendered and Gatsby is statically generated, meaning that gatsby generates statics files, it doesn't need a server. Next.js dynamically renders HTML every time a new request comes to the server.
Build time vs. run time.
Gatsby also dictates how you should handle your data by enforcing GraphQL. Sort of.
