# Gatsby

Gatsby is essentially a static site generator that uses React for the templating together with GraphQL for data fetching at build time.
The process looks something like this

- Data source (eg. markdown, api etc.)
- -> build (powered by graphql)
- -> JS, HTML, CSS files
- -> deploy (Netlify, AWS Amplify, Githug pages)

Gatsby contains

- Modern tools
- Bring your own data
- PWA
- JAMStack [JAMstack | JavaScript, APIs, and Markup](https://jamstack.org/)

Even for developers the hurdle is quite big. Although if you know react you get a lot for free.
