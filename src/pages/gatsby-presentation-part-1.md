# Static site generators with GatsbyJS

## What is a “static site generator”

- Delivers just static files via template and raw data (eg. markdown)
- Thus faster & scalable
  Now, you could just write your own HTML, JS and CSS files. But managing assets and repeated elements can become tedious.

Pros:

- Speed
- Version controlled content
- Security (no user input/authentication)
- Easy to deploy
- Scalable

Cons:

- No real-time content (well, at least it should be avoided)
- No user input

When it's right. It’s great.
